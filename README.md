# I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH THIS YET

This game is still very early in development, it's only *barely* not a block painter.

## Controls

**Minus** and **Plus** to cycle between blocks

**4** to toggle rendering air as a block

**5** to toggle music

**6**, **7**, and **8** to change background color

there are more things you can do with the other number keys, but they're kinda broken right now.

## To-do list

* 1 - add interactions between blocks
* 2 - make the world bigger
* 3 - add liquids


### ***THIS IS A SIDE-PROJECT!!***

***Do not expect frequent updates.***
